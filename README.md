Meaningful Armor Differentiation
==============

This mod makes armor upgrades more impactful by giving more benefits, and a few downsides.
This is designed to make the early-game a little longer and more punishing.

By default crafting and mining speed are very slow, and reach is only 1 tile. You only have 5 inventory squares.
Each tier of armor gives more inventory space, more reach, but slower movespeed.

Radar requires Light Armor or higher.

The Shortcut Bar requires the Toolbelt research.

To gain more mining speed, research the Steel Axe.

To move the fastest, wear no armor.

**Everything is configurable. If you don't like a setting, it can be changed**
